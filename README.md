# Data Science Portfolio  
Welcome to my data science portfolio repository. This repo contains projects and resources related to data science studies and experiments.  

## Projects  

### Housing Price Prediction  
A project focused on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. This section will include notebooks exploring data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.  

### N-gram Text Prediction  
This project aims to build an N-gram model for text prediction. Notebooks in this folder will explore text preprocessing, constructing N-gram models, evaluating predictive performance, and experimenting with smoothing techniques.  

## Directory Structure  

- `notebooks/`  - Jupyter notebooks for each project.  
- `data/`  - Data sets and processed data.  
- `reports/`  - Reports and analyses.  

## Data Sources  
This repository will use various publicly available data sources, including housing datasets (e.g., Kaggle housing price datasets) and text corpora for N-gram modeling. Detailed references will be provided within individual project documentation.  

## Four-week Milestone Calendar  

| Week | Milestone |  
|---|---|  
| Week 1 | Set up repository structure, collect initial datasets, and outline project goals |  
| Week 2 | Develop initial notebooks for data exploration and preprocessing |  
| Week 3 | Implement and evaluate baseline models for both projects |  
| Week 4 | Refine models, generate reports, and prepare presentations |
